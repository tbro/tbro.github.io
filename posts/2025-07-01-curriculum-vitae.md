I'm a versatile software engineer with diverse experience. I've enjoyed writing
`Rust` full time for the past two years. In the past I worked extensively with
`Nodejs` and `Typescript`. I also have worked professionally with `Python`, `Java` and
`Go`. Most recently I worked at startups in the blockchain space. In the past I
have worked at larger companies in hospitality and customer support. I gravitate
toward the back-end, but I have some front-end experience. Beyond writing code, I
have dev-ops skills including experience with `kubernetes` and `terraform`. I tend
toward TDD and try to be (lowercase) agile.

I enjoy a good work/life balance and travel extensively. I work remotely.

## Experience

Most recently I worked in Blockchain space, some examples of my contributions are:

  * Implementation of Merkalized State
  * Implementation of transaction execution
  * Implementation of Block Header production and verification
  * `Rust` <> Etherium inter-op
  * Developed a demo wallet and tooling for testing
  * Implementation of blockchain component of a mobile voting app.

I have also worked on many diverse projects. Some examples:

  * Developed multiple REST APIs in different languages, including `Rust`, `Typescript` and `Java`
  * I made a [TLS certificate generation
	tool](https://github.com/rustls/rcgen/pull/190) (now part of `rustls`
	family).
  * I made [mutually authorized client/server image viewer](https://github.com/tbro/viewd)
  * I did some `angular` UX for customer support
  * I built graphs in `JavaScript` to visualize entity relationships for a non-profit
  * Most recently, I made a small `Linux` cli to [create a WiFi connection by scanning QR code](https://github.com/tbro/scampi)

In addition to the above, I have written many CI pipelines for `github`,
`gitlab` and `circleCI`, many tests, bash scripts and a lot of documentation.

## Languages

  * English (native)
  * Spanish (fluent)
